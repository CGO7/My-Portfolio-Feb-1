# My-Portfolio-Feb-1
My Personal Portfolio Folder

This project was created to begin the construction of my portfolio.  While I do not have much content for these pages, I was able to build the framework for where I will display my work.  I was able to get some information about myself into the project including social media links, and a short Bio.  All together my project consist of 3 pages. Home page, Portfolio page, and a Contact page.  Please enjoy my page.

## Struggles

At the beginning of this project I was still struggling with the concept of families.  This was creating a bi problem for me with the grid system since most floating envolves creating sections, of parents and children.  Once I was able to overcome the family concept, I was able to figure out placements much easier.  I am very satisfied with the end results.
